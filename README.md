# shh

ssh is a library built around [Stem](https://stem.torproject.org/) for creating Tor [hidden services](https://www.torproject.org/docs/hidden-services.html.en) from within a Python program. It also includes a small command line tool for serving local ports or creating simple file servers as hidden services.

In order to start a hidden server you'll need to have [Tor Browser](https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en#downloads) open.
